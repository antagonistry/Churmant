# CHurMant
**Churmant** *(cure-ment)*, is a header for **C language**, it's used for producing *Lua-like* code, but run in the performance of the **C language**.
It also is very easy to maintain and read the header file, if you want to *contribute*. You can also call **Churmant** a *programming language*,
if you want; but it's really not a language. Because it doesn't even has its own **compiler**, just a header. It would be correct if you
said *"C's Churmant Syntax"*. **NOTICE: Churmant can produce Lua-like code only, the code is still unsafe.**
